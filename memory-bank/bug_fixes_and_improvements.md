# ConsultEase - Bug Fixes and Improvements

This document summarizes the recent bug fixes and improvements made to the ConsultEase system to ensure it functions properly.

## Security Improvements

### Password Hashing
- **Issue**: The admin password hashing was using SHA-256, which is not considered secure for password storage.
- **Fix**: Implemented bcrypt password hashing for admin accounts.
- **Details**: 
  - Added bcrypt to requirements.txt
  - Updated the Admin model to use bcrypt for password hashing
  - Added fallback mechanism for backward compatibility with existing SHA-256 hashed passwords
  - Fixed the default admin creation to use the new password hashing method

## Database Improvements

### SQLite Support
- **Issue**: The application was hardcoded to use PostgreSQL, making development and testing more difficult.
- **Fix**: Added SQLite support for easier development and testing.
- **Details**:
  - Updated the database connection code to support both SQLite and PostgreSQL
  - Added environment variables to configure the database type
  - Set up default SQLite database path for development

### Database Management
- **Issue**: There was no way to backup and restore the database from the admin interface.
- **Fix**: Added backup and restore functionality with support for both SQLite and PostgreSQL.
- **Details**:
  - Added backup functionality to the SystemMaintenanceTab
  - Added restore functionality with proper error handling
  - Implemented different backup/restore methods for SQLite and PostgreSQL

### Default Data Creation
- **Issue**: The application required manual setup of initial data.
- **Fix**: Added initialization code to create default data if needed.
- **Details**:
  - Added code to create a default admin user if none exists
  - Added code to create sample faculty data for testing

## RFID Service Improvements

### Callback Management
- **Issue**: RFID callbacks were not properly managed, leading to memory leaks and missed scans.
- **Fix**: Improved callback management in the RFID service.
- **Details**:
  - Added proper registration and unregistration of callbacks
  - Fixed memory leaks by ensuring callbacks are properly cleaned up
  - Added error handling for callback management

### Student Lookup
- **Issue**: Student lookup was happening after notifying callbacks, leading to inconsistent behavior.
- **Fix**: Changed the order to perform student lookup before notifying callbacks.
- **Details**:
  - Ensured the correct student object is passed to callbacks
  - Improved error handling for student lookup

### Error Handling
- **Issue**: RFID scanning errors were not properly handled.
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling for RFID scanning.
- **Details**:
  - Added try-except blocks around critical code
  - Added informative error messages
  - Implemented fallback mechanisms for error recovery

## MQTT Service Improvements

### Network Disconnections
- **Issue**: MQTT service did not handle network disconnections well.
- **Fix**: Improved error handling for MQTT disconnections.
- **Details**:
  - Added exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
  - Enhanced the publish method to handle disconnections and retries
  - Added better logging for MQTT connection issues

## Admin Dashboard Improvements

### CRUD Functionality
- **Issue**: The CRUD functionality in the admin dashboard was not working properly.
- **Fix**: Fixed issues with the admin dashboard CRUD operations.
- **Details**:
  - Fixed the FacultyDialog and StudentDialog classes to properly handle data
  - Removed hardcoded values in dialog classes
  - Improved error handling in CRUD operations
  - Fixed the faculty and student management tabs to properly handle database operations

### Resource Management
- **Issue**: Resources were not properly cleaned up, leading to memory leaks.
- **Fix**: Added proper cleanup methods to ensure resources are released.
- **Details**:
  - Added destructors to ensure cleanup happens when objects are destroyed
  - Fixed memory leaks by ensuring callbacks are properly unregistered
  - Added cleanup methods to tabs and dialogs

### UI Consistency
- **Issue**: The UI theme was inconsistent.
- **Fix**: Set the theme to light as specified in the technical context document.
- **Details**:
  - Updated the theme preference to use light theme
  - Set the theme environment variable to ensure consistency
  - Fixed UI inconsistencies in dialogs and windows

## Error Handling Improvements

### Comprehensive Error Handling
- **Issue**: Error handling was inconsistent throughout the application.
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling throughout the application.
- **Details**:
  - Added try-except blocks around critical code
  - Added informative error messages
  - Implemented fallback mechanisms for error recovery
  - Improved logging for debugging

## Testing and Verification

### Manual Testing
- Verified that all CRUD operations work correctly in the admin dashboard
- Tested RFID scanning functionality with simulation mode
- Verified that the application starts correctly and core navigation works
- Tested database backup and restore functionality
- Verified that the UI theme is consistent

### Next Steps for Testing
- Conduct integration testing with the actual 13.56 MHz RFID reader
- Test with the ESP32 Faculty Desk Unit
- Verify MQTT communication with TLS/SSL
- Conduct user acceptance testing with faculty and students

## Conclusion

These improvements have significantly enhanced the stability, security, and functionality of the ConsultEase system. The application is now ready for integration testing with hardware components and deployment to the target environment.
