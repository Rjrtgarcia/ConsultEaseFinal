# ConsultEase - Progress

## Current Status

We have successfully developed the initial version of the ConsultEase system. The core components have been implemented, including the database models, UI interfaces, controller logic, hardware firmware, and comprehensive user documentation. We've now enhanced the system with touch-friendly UI improvements, on-screen keyboard integration, and a refreshed UI theme with a clean white background and navy blue/gold accent colors.

### What Works
- Project scope and requirements have been defined
- System architecture has been designed
- Technology stack has been selected
- Development approach has been documented
- Database models have been created
- PyQt-based UI components have been implemented
- RFID and MQTT services have been developed
- Controller classes for business logic have been implemented
- Faculty Desk Unit firmware with BLE detection has been created
- BLE beacon firmware for faculty members has been developed
- Comprehensive deployment guides have been written
- User manual with Quick Start Guide and Technical Appendix completed
- Admin interface with faculty and student management implemented
- Touch-optimized UI with larger interface elements
- Automatic on-screen keyboard integration for text fields
- Installation script for touchscreen dependencies
- Refreshed UI theme with white background, navy blue (#0d3b66) and gold (#ffc233) accents for a professional appearance

### What's Left to Build
- Additional UI polish and responsiveness improvements
- Enhanced error handling and edge case management
- Training materials for system users
- Security hardening (encryption, secure authentication)
- Deployment to production hardware
- Integration with existing school systems (if needed)

## Known Issues
- Full error handling for network connectivity issues needs improvement
- Need to implement proper logging throughout the system
- Power management for BLE beacons needs optimization
- Virtual keyboard detection may vary across different Linux distributions
- Touch calibration procedure needs to be refined

## Decisions Evolution

### Initial Decisions
- Chose PyQt5 for UI development based on cross-platform capabilities
- Selected PostgreSQL for database management
- Decided on MQTT for inter-device communication
- Chose ESP32 for Faculty Desk Unit for BLE capabilities and display support

### Changes to Initial Plan
- Expanded RFID service to include simulation mode for testing without hardware
- Added more robust error handling for database operations
- Enhanced faculty presence detection with configurable RSSI thresholds
- Implemented thread-safe approach for UI updates from MQTT messages
- Created comprehensive admin interface with system maintenance functionality
- Added on-screen keyboard support with automatic show/hide behavior
- Enhanced UI with touch-friendly design patterns (larger buttons, proper spacing)
- Created installation scripts for touchscreen-related dependencies
- Updated UI theme to use a white background with navy blue and gold accents for improved aesthetics and readability

## Blockers and Dependencies
- Hardware availability: Raspberry Pi, ESP32, touchscreen, RFID reader, and TFT display
- Network infrastructure: Wi-Fi connectivity and MQTT broker setup
- Production environment setup: Physical installation and mounting
- Touchscreen support: Proper drivers and keyboard utilities installed

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Implement fullscreen mode for touchscreen deployment
2. Create touch calibration guide and tools
3. Enhance error handling and logging
4. Conduct integration testing with real hardware
5. Develop training materials for users
6. Implement security hardening (TLS for MQTT, secure password storage)

## Success Metrics
- RFID scanning reliability: >99% successful reads
- UI responsiveness: <500ms response time
- Faculty presence detection accuracy: >95% 
- System uptime: >99%
- User satisfaction: Positive feedback from students and faculty
- Touch interface usability: Users can complete tasks without assistance
- UI appearance: Consistent, professional look with good contrast and readability
