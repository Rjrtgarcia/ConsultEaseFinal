# ConsultEase - Progress

## Current Status

The system is becoming more stable after addressing several runtime errors, UI inconsistencies, and hardware interaction bugs, particularly related to RFID scanning and application startup on the Raspberry Pi. Core features like student login (via simulation or manual input), admin management (student add/edit/delete with RFID scan/manual input), and basic navigation (logout, fullscreen toggle) are functional.

### What Works
- Project scope and requirements defined
- System architecture designed
- Technology stack selected
- Development approach documented
- Database models created
- PyQt-based UI components implemented (Login, Dashboard, Admin)
- RFID and MQTT services developed
- Controller classes for business logic implemented
- Faculty Desk Unit firmware (initial version)
- BLE beacon firmware (initial version)
- Documentation and deployment guides (initial versions)
- Admin interface with faculty and student management implemented
- Touch-optimized UI (basic styling)
- Automatic on-screen keyboard integration
- Installation script for touchscreen dependencies
- **Application Startup**: Correctly initializes without crashing.
- **Login Screen**: UI layout fixed, manual RFID input added.
- **Admin Student Management**: RFID scanning (including 13.56MHz support via keymap/manual input), add/edit/delete student functionality.
- **Admin Logout**: Correctly returns to the admin login screen.
- **Fullscreen Toggle**: F11 key now toggles fullscreen mode.
- **RFID Service**: Improved handling for different card types and simulation, better callback management, earlier student lookup.

### What's Left to Build / Needs Verification
- **Login Screen RFID**: Verify reliability of student login via RFID scan after service-level fixes.
- **Hardware Integration**: Full integration testing with actual RFID reader (13.56 MHz) and Faculty Desk Unit (ESP32).
- **BLE Presence**: Thorough testing and refinement of BLE detection logic.
- **UI Polish**: Further refinements to UI/UX based on testing.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for edge cases (network issues, hardware failures).
- **Security**: Implement TLS/SSL for MQTT, secure credential storage.
- **Training Materials**: Develop user guides/training.
- **Deployment**: Finalize deployment scripts and procedures.

## Known Issues
- **RFID Hardware Reliability**: Automatic scanning with the 13.56 MHz reader needs verification.
- **BLE Presence Reliability**: Needs extensive testing in a real environment.
- **Network Error Handling**: Needs improvement for MQTT disconnections.
- **Virtual Keyboard**: May require manual toggling (F5) or adjustments depending on the exact Pi setup.
- **UI Theme**: Current theme is dark (default), needs verification against previously mentioned light theme preference.

## Decisions Evolution

### Initial Decisions
- Chose PyQt5, PostgreSQL, MQTT, ESP32.

### Changes to Initial Plan
- Added RFID simulation mode.
- Enhanced faculty presence detection logic.
- Implemented thread-safe UI updates.
- Created comprehensive admin interface.
- Added on-screen keyboard support.
- Optimized UI for touch.
- Created installation scripts.
- **Refined RFID Handling**: Added manual input, improved service logic for different card types, fixed callback management.
- **Improved Startup**: Fixed critical application startup bugs.
- **Added Fullscreen Toggle**: Implemented F11 key for toggling.

## Blockers and Dependencies
- Hardware availability for full integration testing (especially 13.56 MHz reader).
- Network infrastructure stability for MQTT.

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Test student login via RFID scan thoroughly.
2. If possible, test with the actual 13.56 MHz reader.
3. Begin integration testing with ESP32 Faculty Desk Unit.
4. Address any remaining UI/UX bugs or inconsistencies.
5. Verify the intended UI theme (dark vs. light).

## Success Metrics
- RFID scanning reliability: >99% successful reads (including manual input fallback).
- UI responsiveness: <500ms response time.
- Faculty presence detection accuracy: >95%.
- System uptime: >99%.
- User satisfaction: Positive feedback from students and faculty.
- Touch interface usability: Users can complete tasks without assistance.
- UI appearance: Consistent, professional look.
